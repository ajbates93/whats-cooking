# What's Cooking? 🍲

**What's Cooking?** is, at it's core, is a Meal Planning app designed for ease of use. Rather than having two separate lists in my phone, one for the weekly meal plan, and one for the weekly shopping list, why not combine the two in a meal planning app that builds the shopping list up for you as you go. 

- 🍗 Add missing ingredients against a meal!
- 🖱️ Drag and drop meals onto different days!
- 👨🏽‍👩🏻‍👧🏽‍👦🏼 Create your Household and collaborate with family and friends!
